# Intersection-of-local-Arthur-packets
This is a SAGE code for intersection of local Arthur packets of classical groups that implements the algorithms and computations in a [joint work](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.10539) with Alexander Hazeltine and Baiying Liu.

A large portion of the code is built upon [Atobe's code](https://github.com/atobe31/Local-A-packets/tree/main). We include all of his commands, and one can see the explanation there.

By this code, one can compute the following:

- Langlands data for the representations associated to extended multi-segments;
- Local Arthur packets of classical groups.
- Basic operators of extended multi-segments;<br>
- Partial dual of extended multi-segments;<br>
- The set of local Arthur packets containing a representation; <br>
- Determination if a given irreducible representation is of Arthur type or not;<br>
- Determination if an extended multi-segment gives a representation in the associated L-packet;<br>
- The absolutely maximal form and the absolutely maximal form of an extended multi-segment;
- $\psi^{max}(\pi)$ and $\psi^{min}(\pi)$.
