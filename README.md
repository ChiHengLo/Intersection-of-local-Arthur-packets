# Intersection-of-local-Arthur-packets
This is a SAGE code for intersection of local Arthur packets of classical groups.

By this code, one can compute the following:

Langlands data for the representations associated to extended multi-segments;\\
Local Arthur packets of classical groups;
Basic operators of extended multi-segments;
Partial dual of extended multi-segments;
The set of local Arthur packets containing a representation; 
Determination if a given irreducible representation is of Arthur type or not;
Determination if an extended multi-segment gives a representation in the associated L-packet;
The absolutely maximal form and the absolutely maximal form of an extended multi-segment.
